        <p>
        My journey as a musician began 15 years ago when I was 12 years old. My brother had been playing
        guitar for a few years, and of course I wanted to be just like him, but simultaneously not like 
        him at all. In my mind, the perfect blend of the two was to play the bass guitar instead. So, my 
        parents bought me a bass and amp, and started paying for me to take lessons. I fell in love 
        immediately, and soon began playing with my brother at our church. My first real performance, 
        however, was at an event at my high school called "Ms. Snowflake" (see above image).

        <p>About my sophomore year in high school, I met a few fellow musicians and we formed a Band
            called "Weird Body Parts". We started playing shows out in St. Louis, mostly at a venue called
            the Lemp Neighborhood Arts Center. We were able to play with a plethora of different bands
            from across the country, and were able to grow as people and musicians. We eventually 
            recorded and released two full length albums and an EP.

        <p>Over the years, I have been a part of a number of different musical projects at different points
             in time. Below is a list of a few of them with links to recordings/websites.

        <p>By far the most prolific and succesful band I have been a part of has been with 
            my hometown friend Al Holliday. He is a few years older than me, and I rember going to see
            his bands play when I was younger. About 8 years ago, his band needed a new bass player
            and he asked me to join. Since then, we have recorded 3 full length albums that are 
            available on all popular streaming platforms, opened for many amazing bands, and traveled
            across the country. In November of 2018, the band traveled across the Atlantic for a 
            successful European tour. Unfortunately I was unable to go due to my job obligations.

        <p>The highlight of my wedding was of course marrying my beautiful wife. However, one of the 
            highlights of my musical career was being able to perform at my own wedding. My good friends
            in <a  href="http://funkybuttbrassband.com/" target="_blank">The Funky Butt Brass Band</a>
            were our wedding band, and I was able to get on stage and perform a few songs as part
            of our celebration.
