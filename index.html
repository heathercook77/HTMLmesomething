       Illuminati is a mini Austrailian Shephered. He hails from a Ranch in a small town in Mississippi. I got him from a breeder who had free range puppies, and they
            delivered him to me when he was 7 weeks old, while I lived in Florida.
            
            My son Ethan picked, and named him too. He and his school friends choose the name during lunch a week prior to us getting him.

        <p>Illimunatti enjoys food, but only if its prepared correctly. He likes dry food with wet food on top, and it must be stired around on all the food appropriately,
            Not just dumped on top.
            He likes walks and a going to the dog park. He loves his toys, especially the pink Kong one.
            Illuminatti does not like when people leave the house, or if some people are in the house while others are not.
            He loves to be petted, and to be the center of the universe. He also enjoys barking at strangers as they walk by the house.
